##app deployed to heroku - pre-heroku is testProject3

## Grunt.js and Sass
   =================
> Grunt automated tasks: Uglify, Watch, livereload, Sass and default tasks.


### Description


Setup Grunt.js and Sass folder/files

Processed/tested Grunt uglify to minimize my javascript files - ok
  processed all files in my js folder using grunt uglify

Added all files in my JS folder to Grunt watch and assigned them
Grunt watch to automatically Uglify.

Assigned Grunt a default task under watch.

Added livereload task to Grunt
  It works fine with a regular workflow/setup
  Issues: running livereload on port 9292 - it doesn't affect anything though
          as an app with rackup
